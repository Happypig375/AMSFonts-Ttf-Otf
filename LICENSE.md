SIL Open Font Li­cense (ofl)
Ver­sion 1.1 – 26 Fe­bru­ary 2007

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font Li­cense (OFL) are to stim­u­late world­wide de­vel­op­ment of col­lab­o­ra­tive font projects, to sup­port the font cre­ation ef­forts of aca­demic and lin­guis­tic com­mu­ni­ties, and to pro­vide a free and open frame­work in which fonts may be shared and im­proved in part­ner­ship with oth­ers.

The OFL al­lows the li­censed fonts to be used, stud­ied, mod­i­fied and re­dis­tributed freely as long as they are not sold by them­selves. The fonts, in­clud­ing any deriva­tive works, can be bun­dled, em­bed­ded, re­dis­tributed and/or sold with any soft­ware pro­vided that any re­served names are not used by deriva­tive works. The fonts and deriva­tives, how­ever, can­not be re­leased un­der any other type of li­cense. The re­quire­ment for fonts to re­main un­der this li­cense does not ap­ply to any doc­u­ment cre­ated us­ing the fonts or their deriva­tives.
