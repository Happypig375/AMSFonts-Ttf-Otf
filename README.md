The fonts in the [AMSFonts package](https://ctan.org/pkg/amsfonts),
converted to TTF and OTF files using [TransType 4](https://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/transtype/).
-----------------------

The original PostScript font files use an ancient format that is not well supported today.
As a result, I converted all of them into TrueType and OpenType files using TransType 4.

The content in TTF files are identical to that in OTF files; I added OTF in addition to TTF because the OTF files are smaller in size.

Feel free to use them all!

**PS: the fonts in [amsfonts-otf.zip](https://github.com/Happypig375/AMSFonts-Ttf-Otf/blob/master/amsfonts-otf.zip) is converted from AMSFonts(Type1) to OTF using the open source software [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/) by Firestar-Reimu.**

I do not provide the TTF files because [this](https://fontforge.org/docs/techref/bezier.html?highlight=spline):

_PostScript fonts(OTF and Type1) use qubic splines but TrueType fonts(TTF) use quadratic splines._
