The fonts in the [AMSFonts package](https://ctan.org/pkg/amsfonts),
converted to TTF and OTF files using [TransType 4](https://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/transtype/).
-----------------------

The original PostScript font files use an ancient format that is not well supported today.
As a result, I converted all of them into TrueType and OpenType files using TransType 4.

The content in TTF files are identical to that in OTF files; I added OTF in addition to TTF because the OTF files are smaller in size.

Feel free to use them all!
